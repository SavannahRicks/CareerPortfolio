                    <h2>My Education</h2>
                    <p>I am a Graduate of Penn State Erie, The Behrend College and I studied Digital Media, Arts & Technology (DIGIT) and minored in Writing & Digital Media. When I first started at Penn State, I was initially a Computer Science major. After a year, I realized that Computer Science was not for me. I enjoyed the coding aspect, but I felt like I needed to visually see the creations I was making. When I found that the DIGIT major had both coding and arts, I knew I had to switch majors, and I am so glad I did! Building websites is one of my favorite things to do now; I love how there is problem solving, instant results, and a mix of art. Because the languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. are always changing, there is always something to learn! I know that I do not know everything about web dev, but I am always looking for something new to expand my knowledge.</p>

                    <h2>Marketing Intern Experience</h2>
                    <p>In May 2025, I began my internship with Country Fair. My experience with them has been incredibly exciting and knowledgeable. Working alongside my supervisor and another intern, we focused on marketing events at Country Fair Stores across PA and neighboring states. These events offered food and prizes to new and current country fair customers to show our gratitude to our customers. We would also promote the company’s loyalty program with the goal of reaching 30 percent usage company wide. By August 2025 we successfully hit that goal! In between event days, we’d all split off to visit a couple stores a day, where we’d advertise the loyalty program on our own. During which, I would ask the store workers of any comments, questions or concerns regarding the program. Throughout the summer, I have been taking in technical, user and quality complaints. Throughout these complaints I noticed a consistent issue that had been recurring throughout most of the stores we interacted with. With this I had notified my higher-ups of the issue, resulting in the improvement of the overall quality control steps that were taken going forward.</p>

                    <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
                    <p>To be honest, I don’t have a set plan for where I want to go. I just know I want to at least find a job where I can build websites, whether that be User Experience/Interface, Web Developer, Web Designer, or Front-End Developer. Wherever I work, the flexibility to learn and grow in my profession is a must!</p>
                    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>When I am not building websites, I am sitting on my couch crocheting! I have been crocheting for five years now and have many projects under my belt. I’ve made afghans, beanies, tops, cat accessories, pillows, and stuffed animals. My favorite projects I’ve completed was a pair or granny square pants! </p>

                    <p>This is Lo Mein! She is almost 5 years old, and I’ve had her since I was a college Freshman. She is the sweetest and sassiest cat I’ve ever had. She is also the most chaotic! She loves it when we play a game we call “string” (when I dangle a piece of yarn). She also loves her little mousy toys, her three-foot-long tunnel, and sleeping under rugs. Lo Mein is also very quiet. The only time she will meow is when I close a door on her because she hates being away from me. </p>
